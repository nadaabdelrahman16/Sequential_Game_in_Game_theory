# Sequential_Game_in_Game_theory
In game theory, a sequential game is a game where one player chooses their action before the others choose theirs. Importantly, the later players must have some information of the first's choice, otherwise the difference in time would have no strategic effect.
Consider a sequential game between three players. Player 1 moves first (i.e., has one decision 
node), and has n actions. Player 2 has n decision nodes, and has m  actions at each 
decision node. Player 3 moves last and has decision nodes and has k  actions at each 
decision node.

A) Implement a decision tree for this sequential game.the tree is implemented for any arbitrary number of actions at each decision node, and the tree is implemented for any arbitrary number of players.


B) Solve the sequential game using backward induction.
